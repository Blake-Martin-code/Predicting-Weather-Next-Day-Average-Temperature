# Predicting-Weather-Next-Day-Average-Temperature

This involves a jupyter notebook where I write my own linear regression functions and I apply them to weather data provided by Colorado State University

- All links are within the code as well as explanations of how to do it

## Key Notes

- It is interesting to see that predicting the next day average temperature is more accurate when you predict the change in temperature rather than directly predicting the next days temperature.


##### This is a school assignment so I had a guide, but it was all relatively easy.
